# 2019 BADM Hackathon Training

These files I put together as part of the 2019 Business Analytics and Decision Making(BADM) Hackathon at Simon Frser University. They teach participants how to clean a dataset and perform predictive analytics to determine customer churn using logistic regression, stepwise regression, a basic classification tree, a basic neural network and a random forest. Participants are scored on model preformance and business case which is why moel interpretation samples are shown in the slides.
